# Science as a Social Enterprise

**1.1 The Shaping of Knowledge in Science**
- Barry Marshall writes a letter about a bacteria that causes all stomach ulcer disease and that chronic ulcer recurrence could be eradicated by common antibiotics and pepto bismal
- This letter was seen as crazy and revolutional if true, many doubters. but problem was bad enough for the letter to get some attention
- Marshall had trouble for 10 years with this problem and getting it widely accepted by the scientific community
- got a Nobel Prize in Medicine
- most of his trouble was with his methods and conclusions, how he experimented and showed his results
- 'How do you get Scientists to listen to you?'
- He tested it on himself, people were mad
- his theory also breached the widely known thought on stomach lining
- communication is important!!!

**1.2 The Social Nature of Science**
- Science is a community
- we base everything we do in science off of previously made assumptions
- a "gestalt" switch is when you see a problem in a new context, that allows you to find the solution
- sometimes the solution is to violate and ignore conventional beliefs and assumptions (quote this)

**1.3 The Centrality of Communication in Science**
- centrality in scientific communication seems counterproductive but it really is the foundation of good science
- '"If scientists were prevented from communicating with each other, scientific progress would grind to a halt"'
- 'Sharing ideas is essential to the evolution of every scientific field'
- the scientist who gets their paper to the journal first gets the credit
- The Royal Society of London was created to protect the rights of authors in this way
- Marshall and Warren wrote a preliminary report instead of a full research report, so did Watson and Crick
- journals run on a peer-review system for quality control
- pre-publication bypasses the checks and balances and is risky
- Pons and Fleischmann came out with a paper that was later marked erraneous and they didn't give any details about experiment for recreatablity

**1.4 The Role of Persuasion in Scientific Communication**
- 'To be persuasive, scientists must make the claims of their research believable in the context of the previous research and the existing paradigm of the field'
- they must also present in a professional way that is accepted by the scientific community

**1.5 Scientific Communication and Convenction**
- learning conventions happen overtime 
- we have been learning conventions ever since we started learning about our field
- need to understand field to read, and need to be able to read to understand field
- let the socialization process take it's course, in teaching you how to initiate into your scientific community
