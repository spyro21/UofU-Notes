# Science as a Social Enterprise

**1.1 The Shaping of Knowledge in Science**
- Barry Marshall writes a letter about a bacteria that causes all stomach ulcer disease and that chronic ulcer recurrence could be eradicated by common antibiotics and pepto bismal
- This letter was seen as crazy and revolutional if true, many doubters. but problem was bad enough for the letter to get some attention
- Marshall had trouble for 10 years with this problem and getting it widely accepted by the scientific community
- got a Nobel Prize in Medicine
- most of his trouble was with his methods and conclusions, how he experimented and showed his results
- 'How do you get Scientists to listen to you?'
- He tested it on himself, people were mad
- his theory also breached the widely known thought on stomach lining
- communication is important!!!

**1.2 The Social Nature of Science**
- Science is a community
- we base everything we do in science off of previously made assumptions
- a "gestalt" switch is when you see a problem in a new context, that allows you to find the solution
- sometimes the solution is to violate and ignore conventional beliefs and assumptions (quote this)
