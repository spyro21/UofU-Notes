# Annoying Ways People Use Sources

- sloppy writing is like slow driving
- uses a metaphor to describe the effects of sloppy quoting

**Annoyances**
- dont surprise with a quotation, use a good introduction of the quote
  - signal quote is coming
  - introduce the author
  - show how the reader can interpret it

- dont start or end a paragraph with a quotation
  - because you just heard this interesting quote and then there is nothing
  - when starting with a quotation, you don't know the context
  - the fix: guide and lead away the reader from the quotation
    - "prepare, quote, analyze" (247)
  - quotation at the beginning can be exciting, hook the reader in
    - "quote, explain"

- dont use too many quotations in a row
  - return to each quotation and decide why its there and massage it in accordingly

- don't fail to integrate a quotation into the grammar of the preceding sentence
  - use [] to change grammar, or lead into quote with right grammar

- dont incorrectly do work cited
  - make sure that the first word in your parenthetical citation is the one in the work cited too

- dont drop a citation without making it clear what information came from that source
  - citations can sometimes confuse the reader on what are the cited sources thoughts and what are your thoughts
  - to fix this, write sentences to specify what information came from where
