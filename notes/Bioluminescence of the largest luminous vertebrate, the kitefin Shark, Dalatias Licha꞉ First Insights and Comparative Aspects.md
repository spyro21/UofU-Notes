# Bioluminescence of the largest luminous vertebrate, the kitefin Shark, Dalatias Licha: First Insights and Comparative Aspects

**Introduction**
- very hard to read as a lay reader
- seems to be listing facts
- defines a couple terms like bioluminescence and different bioluminescent species
- some facts heavily rely on terminology knowledge
- a lot of listing of species which make me more and more disinterested in learning from this paper

**Specimen Sampling**
- notified where samples were gotten
- heavy detail on how the shark was caught
- how many were caught and used for study
- procedure on holding and screening of sharks

**Photophore Histology and Density** and **Pharmacological Studies**
- exact procedure on experiment and methods


**OVERALL**
very formal and scientific. follows IMRAD
