# Scientific Communication: Historical Realities for Readers and Writers

**Matters of history**
- Over time language changes, and that is no different for scientific writing
- Newton's paper had a lot of I in it (Newtonian's "I")
- This was replaced by a sort of observing god
- now all conversational touches seem to go away
- over time there has been an increase on terminology

**Where We Came From: the Beginnings of Modern Sicentific Expression**
- Bacon created one of the first scientific societies

**Scientific Rhetoric**
- Watson and Crick did not follow IMRAD, but wrote a very clever paper on DNA.
- the organization and flow of the argument over steps the articles downfalls
- highly concise, 'to "build" a structure through specific details'
- frequent use of 'we' because the scientific community is competive, and they are claiming this victory as their own and not shared with anyone else.
- flow goes like this: announcement -> dismissal of competitors -> main proposal -> qualifications -> finale
- you have to tell the importance of your article to the reader
- 'if then' clause is very common in scientific communication
   - it allows for the reader to be led through a story

**Grammar**
- Scientific writing can be broken down into simple sentences when you take the technological smoke away
- don't let grammar cripple you
- there will be grammar police, don't worry about them
- grammar should'nt halt you from writing a single sentence

**The Role of Software**
- computing has helped us do the little things not by hand anymore (spelling)
- scientific community split on use of technology to aide
- technology takes away the human touch to an article
- overreliance on software leads to many problematic manuscripts
- This software discussion didn't mention AI, which probably wasn't a thing.

**What it means to Write and Speak well in Science**
- writing in science is not held to a high standard like other professions are
- nonfiction has many important fundamental writing questions (formal/informal, audience, style)
- we don't have to worry about these questions in science :)
- we do need to worry about structure, rythm, strategic employment of rhetorical technique
- everything we write is history, and we need to be aware of it.
- also this is communication, we have to write something to provide discourse in the community
